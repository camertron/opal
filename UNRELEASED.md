## Highlights

### `Hash` is now bridged to JavaScript `Map`

This change brings a lot of benefits, but also some incompatibilities. The main benefit is that `Hash` now is both more performant and relies on native JavaScript capabilities.
This improves interoperability with JavaScript. As a downside, applications reaching for internal `Hash` data structures will need to be updated.

Interacting with `Hash` from `JavaScript` is easier than ever:

```ruby
hash = `new Map([['a', 1], ['b', 2]])`
hash # => {a: 1, b: 2}
`console.log(hash)` # => Map(2)Â {"a" => 1, "b" => 2}
`hash.get('a')` # => 1
`hash.set('c', 3)`
hash # => {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
hash.keys # => ["a", "b", "c"]
hash.values # => [1, 2, 3]
```

### Performance improvements

This release brings a lot of performance improvements, our tests on Asciidoctor show a 25% improvement in performance, but we've seen up to 66% performance improvement on some applications.
